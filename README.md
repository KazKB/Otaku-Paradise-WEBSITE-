Otaku Paradise is a basic ecommerce website that specialises in sellings anime merchandise. Users are not able to actually purchase any merchandise. The sites aim is to demonstrate the basic skills that were taught in an introductory class for web development. So, the site is more visual than practical. Otaku Paradise was worked on for two iterations. The first iteration was originally a pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript project for an introductory web development course done as a team as shown on the About Us page. While the second iteration was done solo with PHP added to it. The PHP was to allow login and sign up (profile), reviews (comments) and a cart to be functional rather than just visual. The relevant data were saved to CSV files or session variables.
